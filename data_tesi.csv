2,"The concept of a circular economy – currently widely promoted in Asia – has its conceptual roots in industrial ecology, which envisions a form of material symbiosis between otherwise very different companies and production processes. Industrial ecology emphasises the benefits of recycling residual waste materials and by-products through, for example, the development of complex interlinkages, such as those in the renowned industrial symbiosis projects (see Jacobsen 2006). However, in more general terms, it promotes resource minimisation and the adoption of cleaner technologies (Andersen 1997, 1999).",Andersen,2007,"the concept of a circular economy – currently widely promoted in asia – has its conceptual roots in industrial ecology, which envisions a form of material symbiosis between otherwise very different companies and production processes. industrial ecology emphasises the benefits of recycling residual waste materials and by products through, for example, the development of complex interlinkages, such as those in the renowned industrial symbiosis projects . however, in more general terms, it promotes resource minimisation and the adoption of cleaner technologies ."
109,"The circular economy, which is a mode of economic development based on ecological circulation of natural materials, requires compliance with ecological laws and sound utilization of natural resources to achieve economic development. It is, essentially, an ecological economy that follows the principles of ‘‘reducing  resource use, reusing, and recycling’’, with the objectives of reducing the resources that enter the production process, effecting multiple use of the same resources in different ways, and reusing waste from one facility as a resource for other facilities.

20,"Therefore China’s idea of circular economy has its own characteristics. The author believes at least the following characteristics are worth emphasizing. First, China’s circular economy is an idea about the economic pattern in respect of nature rather than an idea about environmental management in some other countries, because China hopes to reduce resource consumption and pollutant production at sources and in the whole process by changing the economic pattern. It also hopes to achieve win-win in both economy and environment by circular economy instead of ‘economy without recycle’ or ‘recycle without economy’; therefore the department proposed for planning circular economy as a whole in China is the State Development and Reform Commission which has a comprehensive nature instead of environmental management departments in some other countries. Second, China’s circular economy not only aims at garbage economy or 3R economy for treating solid waste in respect of objects but at all scarce resources involved in China’s economic development, including water, land, energy, materials and corresponding waste; to a certain extent, it is of more urgent significance for China to develop circular economy which deals with consumption of water, land, energy and other resources and control of related pollutants. Third, China’s circular economy comprises different space levels in respect of scale and includes circular economy of individual enterprises, industrial parks and regions, etc. Fourth, China’s circular economy stresses progressively increased practice forms on the following three levels in respect of pattern and emphasizes the need to develop from low-level recycle of waste based on ecological efficiency (to reduce consumption and pollution) to high-level recycle of products and services based on ecological effects (to prevent consumption and pollution).

65,"By organising economic activities in a closed loop of materials, the CE policy promotes harmony between the economic system and the ecosystem (CCICED 2003). This promotes new types of industrialisation, including ‘product and service design to promote reduce, reuse and recycling of materials’ and ‘sustainable product and service design’. In this regard, Stahel (1982) developed a conceptual and methodological framework of great value to planning and implementing a more CE in China, based on product life extension, the service or functional economy, and the notion of products as service carriers.

35,"The Chinese people have chosen to use the term ‘circular economy’ as the working language of EID. The terminology may not be very familiar to Western readers, but in China it is understood to mean the realisation of a closed loop of materials flow in the whole economic system. Different from the traditional linear production model, a circular economy approach encourages the organisation of economic activities with feedback processes which mimic natural ecosystems through a process of ‘natural resources→transformation into manufactured products → byproducts of manufacturing used as resources for other industries.’ In essence, the circular economy approach is the same as the more familiar terms EID and ‘industrial ecology’, and fits comfortably within a broad range of ecological modernisation initiatives pioneered around the world. The Chinese circular economy concept comes originally from Germany and Japan, where there was a desire to form a more closed loop society (Wang et al. 2004). It advocates that economic systems could and should operate according to the materials and energy cycling principles that drive natural systems. These include ecosystemic self-sustaining properties, through the recycling of essential materials and energy, the capacity for one organism’s wastes to be used as a resource by another organism, and through self-organisation capacities.",Geng & Doberstein,2008,"the chinese people have chosen to use the term circular economy as the working language of eid. the terminology may not be very familiar to western readers, but in china it is understood to mean the realisation of a closed loop of materials flow in the whole economic system. different from the traditional linear production model, a circular economy approach encourages the organisation of economic activities with feedback processes which mimic natural ecosystems through a process of natural resources→transformation into manufactured products → byproducts of manufacturing used as resources for other industries. in essence, the circular economy approach is the same as the more familiar terms eid and industrial ecology, and fits comfortably within a broad range of ecological modernisation initiatives pioneered around the world. the chinese circular economy concept comes originally from germany and japan, where there was a desire to form a more closed loop society . it advocates that economic systems could and should operate according to the materials and energy cycling principles that drive natural systems. these include ecosystemic self sustaining properties, through the recycling of essential materials and energy, the capacity for one organisms wastes to be used as a resource by another organism, and through self organisation capacities."

27,"For the purpose of this economic analysis, the circular economy is defined as an economy that provides multiple value-creation mechanisms which are decoupled from the consumption of finite resources (Figure 8). This definition rests on three principles:  Preserve and enhance natural capital by controlling finite stocks and balancing renewable resource flows – for example, replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy or returning nutrients to ecosystems.  Optimise resource yields by circulating products, components, and materials in use at the highest utility at all times in both technical and biological cycles – for example, sharing or looping products and extending product lifetimes. Foster system effectiveness by revealing and designing out negative externalities, such as water, air, soil, and noise pollution; climate change; toxins; congestion; and negative health effects related to resource use.

These principles are well deﬁned, but also broad enough for almost any entity to adapt for its own purposes and operations.","Mulrow, Derrible, Ashton, & Chopra",2017,"as a concept, the circular economy  is being discussed and practiced at scales ranging from the individual product or ﬁrm to global supply chains and the entire globalized economy. moreover, circular economy practices hold consequence not only for environmental impact, but also for economic performance, human well being, and cultural shift toward a sustainability paradigm . the ellen macarthur foundation  , a uk based charitable organization, has proposed three principles of a ce:  preserve and enhance natural capital;  optimize resource yields; and  foster system effectiveness. these principles are well deﬁned, but also broad enough for almost any entity to adapt for its own purposes and operations."

66,"The CE, though, seeks to have no net impact on the environment, by restoring any damage done in resource acquisition while minimizing waste generated during the production and life cycle of products. Moreover, it has been claimed that CE approaches will generate jobs and improve competitiveness, while fostering energy savings and reducing GHG emissions (EC 2015b). The objective of decoupling economic growth from re-source consumption is at the heart of the CE, according to Gregson and colleagues (2015), reﬂected in the emphasis on resource efﬁciency. In the CE, reuse and remanufacture conserve more value than recycling (Stahel and Reday-Mulvey 1981). Most recycling is down cycling, with reduced quality and value (Braungart et al. 2007). It is not only important to use resources and goods more efﬁciently, but also to limit unnecessary demand—reduce or prevent in the 3R’s waste hierarchy (Stahel 1997; Cooper 2005). The circular economy (CE) concept has emerged as a way to obtain more value from resources while reducing material throughput. It involves closed-loop and cooperative approaches, reuse, adaptation, resource stewardship, stock management, sharing, and other new business models.",Ness & Xing,2017,"the ce, though, seeks to have no net impact on the environment, by restoring any damage done in resource acquisition while minimizing waste generated during the production and life cycle of products. moreover, it has been claimed that circular economy approaches will generate jobs and improve competitiveness, while fostering energy savings and reducing ghg emissions . the objective of decoupling economic growth from re source consumption is at the heart of the ce, according to gregson and colleagues , reﬂected in the emphasis on resource efﬁciency. in the ce, reuse and remanufacture conserve more value than recycling . most recycling is down cycling, with reduced quality and value . it is not only important to use resources and goods more efﬁciently, but also to limit unnecessary demand—reduce or prevent in the 3rs waste hierarchy . the circular economy  concept has emerged as a way to obtain more value from resources while reducing material throughput. it involves closed loop and cooperative approaches, reuse, adaptation, resource stewardship, stock management, sharing, and other new business models."

34,"We define the Circular Economy as a regenerative system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimised by slowing, closing, and narrowing material and energy loops. This can be achieved through long-lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling.","Geissdoerfer, Savaget, Bocken, & Hultink",2017,"we define the circular economy as a regenerative system in which resource input and waste, emission, and energy leakage are minimised by slowing, closing, and narrowing material and energy loops. this can be achieved through long lasting design, maintenance, repair, reuse, remanufacturing, refurbishing, and recycling."
78,"Such a strategy can be informed by circular economy (CE) principles such as reuse and recycling (Ramoni and Zhang 2013). A circular or closed-loop economy aims to eliminate waste by cycling materials and products within the system to achieve resource and energy efﬁciency as well as proﬁtability (EMF 2013; McKinsey & Company 2014; Allwood et al. 2011, 2012; Gregson et al. 2015; Ghisellini et al. 2016).","Richa, Babbitt, & Gaustad",2017,such a strategy can be informed by circular economy  principles such as reuse and recycling . a circular or closed loop economy aims to eliminate waste by cycling materials and products within the system to achieve resource and energy efﬁciency as well as proﬁtability .
79,"To support both economic growth and sustainable resource management, the circular economy paradigm seems to be a great opportunity for industrial practitioners. Indeed, the promises and benefits from circular practices have been comprehensively discussed in literature (EMF, 2013b; CIRAIG, 2015; MGI, 2015; Lacy, 2015; Ghisellini et al., 2016). The circular economy is seen as a restorative solution with the potential to eliminate waste (EC, 2015a; EEA, 2015; EEA, 2016). Also, it could both secure Europe’s competitiveness and ensure benefits from the three piliars of sustainable development (Banaitė, 2016 Sauvé et al., 2016; Geissdoerfer et al., 2017). Particularly, using closed-loop approaches mitigate manufacturers' dependency on virgin materials and decrease price volatility (Kiser, 2016).","Saidani, Yannou, Leroy, & Cluzel",2017,"to support both economic growth and sustainable resource management, the circular economy paradigm seems to be a great opportunity for industrial practitioners. indeed, the promises and benefits from circular practices have been comprehensively discussed in literature . the circular economy is seen as a restorative solution with the potential to eliminate waste . also, it could both secure europes competitiveness and ensure benefits from the three piliars of sustainable development . particularly, using closed loop approaches mitigate manufacturers' dependency on virgin materials and decrease price volatility ."

112,"The concept of the “circular economy” has gained signiﬁcant traction since its introduction a half century ago (Boulding 1966). Scholars, practitioners, governments, and non-governmental organizations have recognized the apparent appeal of closing material loops, reusing and recycling industrial “nutrients” to extract their maximum value with minimum waste (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2016; Frosch and Gallopoulos 1989; Yuan et al. 2006). There are many “schools of thought” regarding the circular economy that share a central theme, but differ in their intended outcomes and optimal implementations (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2016). Some of these concentrate on minimizing waste and resource extraction (EC 2016a; Nansai et al. 2014), others focus on economic growth potential (Ellen MacArthur Foundation 2015; McKinsey & Company2014; Morgan and Mitchell 2015), and others on environmental impact reduction (e.g., Allwood 2014).",Zink & Geyer,2017,"the concept of the circular economy has gained signiﬁcant traction since its introduction a half century ago . scholars, practitioners, governments, and non governmental organizations have recognized the apparent appeal of closing material loops, reusing and recycling industrial nutrients to extract their maximum value with minimum waste . there are many schools of thought regarding the circular economy that share a central theme, but differ in their intended outcomes and optimal implementations . some of these concentrate on minimizing waste and resource extraction , others focus on economic growth potential , and others on environmental impact reduction ."
